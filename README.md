This project was not originally created by me; it was developed as part of my learning journey in Java.
The primary focus is on understanding GUI development and game creation techniques.

<b>Wave Enemies Game </b> is a dynamic and engaging Java-based application designed to challenge players through multiple waves of enemies, each with distinct behaviors and speeds. This game serves as a practical tool for learning game development fundamentals and enhances user interaction skills by controlling a player character via keyboard inputs.

<b>Technical Specifications:</b>

  Data Structure: Uses Java classes and interfaces to manage game objects like players and enemies. Each object type inherits from a common GameObject class that handles attributes such as position and movement.

  Functionality: Includes player movement, collision detection, enemy spawning, and game state management. Features an incremental difficulty level where enemies gain speed and complexity as the game progresses.

  Interactivity: Offers a simple and intuitive user interface using Java Swing, allowing players to start the game, pause, and resume. The HUD provides real-time updates on player health and score, enhancing the gameplay experience with immediate feedback.
