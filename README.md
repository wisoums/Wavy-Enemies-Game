This project was not originally created by me; it was developed as part of my learning journey in Java.
The primary focus is on understanding GUI development and game creation techniques.

This project features a "Wave Enemies" game developed in Java, designed to explore the fundamentals of game development, including game mechanics, collision detection, and user input handling. The game challenges players to survive waves of enemies with varying abilities and speeds.
