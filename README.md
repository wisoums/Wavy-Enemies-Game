This project WAS NOT originally created by me; it was developed as part of my learning journey in Java.
The primary focus is on understanding GUI development and game creation techniques.

<b>Wave Enemies Game </b> is a dynamic and engaging Java-based application designed to challenge players through multiple waves of enemies, each with distinct behaviors and speeds. This game serves as a practical tool for learning game development fundamentals and enhances user interaction skills by controlling a player character via keyboard inputs.

<b>Technical Specifications:</b>

  - Architecture: Leverages object-oriented programming to structure game elements like players, enemies, and the game environment. Each game entity is derived from a common GameObject class, which encapsulates characteristics such as position and movement behavior.

  - Functionality: Features include handling player controls, detecting collisions between objects, managing enemy spawn mechanics, and tracking game states. The game difficulty increases as players progress, introducing faster and more challenging enemies.

  - Interactivity: Utilizes Java Swing for the graphical user interface, providing a straightforward menu system for game controls and navigation. A Heads-Up Display (HUD) offers real-time feedback on player stats like health and score, enhancing user engagement and gameplay strategy.
